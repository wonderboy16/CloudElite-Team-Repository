    A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
    A function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
    Any number of scripts can be placed in the <body> or <head> section of an HTML page

    External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
    EX:<script src="myScript.js"></script>. External scirpts cannot contain <script> tags
    Using external files helps seperate HTML and code, it makes HTML and Javascript easier to read and maintain and speeds up page loads.   
-->

        <p>javaScript can "Display" data in different ways</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Writing into an HTMl element, using <b>innerHTML</b></li>
            <li>Writing into the HTML output using <b>document.write()</b></li>
            <li>Writing into an alrt box, using <b>window.alert()</b></li>
            <li>Writing into the browser console, using <b>console.log()</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To access an HTML element, Javascript can use the document.getElementById('id') method.
            The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTMl property defines the HTMl content.
            Changing the innerHTML property of an HTML element is a common way to display data in HTML.
        </p>
        <p id="example"></p>
        <script>
            document.getElementById('example').innerHTML = 9 * 4;
        </script>

        <script>
            document.write(2 * 10);
        </script>

        <p>Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML.
            document.write() method should only be used for testing
        </p>
        <button type="button" onclick="document.write(9+9)">This button deletes all HTML document</button>

        <p>You can use an alert box to display data by declaring window.alert() </p>
        <!--<script>window.alert("This is a safe website click OK or enter to continue to the site.")</script>-->

        <p>For debugging purposes, you can use the console.log() method to display data.
            <b> Activate debugging by pressing F12 on your keyboard then Select "Console" in the debugger menu</b>
        </p>
        <script>
                console.log(0 * 5);
                console.log("This message will display in your console automatically. Make sure to store your code in a script tag in order to use console.log ");
                var ck
                ck = (2*5);
                var wk = ("Emmanuel");
        </script>
        
        <h3>JavaScript Statements</h3>

        <p>A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements. In HTML, JavaSCript programs are executed by the
            web browser.
            JavaSCript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.
            <p id="ex2"></p>
            <p id="ex3"></p>
        </p>

        <script>
            var x, y, z
            x = 9
            y = 2
            z = x + y;
            document.getElementById("ex2").innerHTML = "The value of z is" + z + ".";</script>

        <p>JavaSCript statemens are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and comments.
            The statement below tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="ex3".
        </p>
        <script>
            document.getElementById("ex3").innerHTML = "Hello people";
        </script>

        <p>Semicolons seperate JavaSCript statements. Add a semicolons at the end of each executable statement it's not
            required but highly recommended.
            With semicolons multiple statements on one line is allowed. JavaScript ignores white spaces but you can add
            white
            spaces to make your script more readable. Put spaces around operators(= + - * /)
            <p id="ex4"> </p>
        </p>

        <script>
            var a, b, c;
            a = 5; b = 9;
            c = 1;
            d = a + b + c;
            document.getElementById("ex4").innerHTML = "The answer is " + d;
        </script>
        <p>For the best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
            The best place to break a lone script line is after an operator. JavaScript statements can be grouped
            together in code blocks,
            inside curly brackets by using a semicolon{....} Ex:
            <!-- <script> function myFunction() {
                document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
                document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
              } </script>-->
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript Keywords</h3>
        <p>JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.</p>
        <table class="tab">

        <p>With <b>JavaScript literals</b> Numbers are written with or without decimals and strings are text written
            within double or single quotes
            The var keyword is used to declare variables, an equal sign is used to assign values to variables. EX:
            For comments in JAvaSCript use // or /* */
            <!--var x;
            x = 6;
        
            var x, y;
            x = 5 + 6;
            y = x * 10;
             -->
        </p><br>

        <p>JavaScript Identifiers are names. All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive
            Hyphens like <b>first-name</b> are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions
            Upper camel case like <b>FirstName</b> lower camel case and underscore are allowed.
        </p>
        <p id="ex5"></p>
        <script>
            var lastname, lastName;
            lastname = 'Doe'
            lastName = 'Peterson'
            document.getElementById("ex5").innerHTML = lastname + " " + lastName;
        </script>

        <p>JavaScript uses the Unicode character set. Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and
            symbols in the world.
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/default.asp" target="_blank">Complete Unicode Reference.<a />
        </p>

        <p>If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
            for example: var x = "5" + 2 + 3; will result in 523 but var x = 2 + 3 + "5"; will result in 55.
            x ** y produces the same result as [Math.pow(5,2) = 25].
        </p>

        <p>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
            When evaluating expresions JavaScript will treat preceding operands as a string if the first operand is a
            string.
            for example var x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4; will <b>result</b> in Volvo164 but var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo"; will
            <b>result</b> in 20Volvo.
        </p>

        <p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string
            EXAMPLE: var answer1 = "It's alright"; OR var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
        </p>

        <p>JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
            EXAMPLE: var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; <b>REVIEW DATATYPES</b>
        </p>

        <p>JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
            EXAMPLE: var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
            The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression. typeof "" //Returns "string"
            Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined or null.
        </p>

        <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particukar task.
            A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
            Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function so
            Local variables cannot be accessed from outside of the function.

        </p>

        <p id="ex6"></p>
        <script>
            function myFunction(p1, p2){
                return p1 * p2;
                var func = myFunction(p1,p2);
                
            }
            document.getElementById("ex6").innerHTML = myFunction(4, 1);
            
        </script>
        

        <p>You can access object properties in two ways.
            #1 objectName.propertyName #2 objectName["PropertyName"]
            In a function definition, <b>this</b> refers to the owner of the function.
            If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition.
            When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object
            The equality operator (==) will attempt to make the data types the same before proceeding. On the other hand, 
            the identity operator (===) requires both data types to be the same, as a prerequisite.
        </p>

        <p>HTML events are things that happen to HTML elements. When JavaSCript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can
            react on these events.
            Examples of HTML events include: An HTML web page has finished loading, An HTML input field was changed,
            An HTML button was clicked.[ < element event="some JavaScript">]
        </p>
        <p id="ex7"></p>

        <button onclick="document.getElementById('ex7').innerHTML = Date()">The time is </button><br>
        <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">What is the time</button>
        <button onclick="displayDate()">Now the time is?</button>

        <p> A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes that is declared as a (var) you can use single or double quotes </p>
        <p>To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property. The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters.
            For example "It\"s alright.";<br>
            The indexOf() method returns the index of (the position of) the first occurrence of a specified text in a string.
            Both indexOf(), and lastIndexOf() return -1 if the text is not found.<br>
            The search() method searches a string for a specified value and return the position of the match
        </p><br>

        <script>
            var text ="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ9";
            var tln = text.length;
            console.log(tln, 'is the text length'); //check your console to find out the text length
            var inde = text.indexOf("M"); // finds the index of a character
            console.log(inde);
            var inde2 = text.lastIndexOf("Z");
            console.log(inde2, 'this is the location of z');
            var posi = text.search("J");
            console.log(posi)
            
        </script>

        <p>
            For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
            A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition (+)
            String slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string. This method takes
            two parameters: the start position and the end position. Example str.slice(7, 13).
            bubstring() is similar to slice() but it cannot accept negative indexes. The substr() method is also similar to the 
            the slice() method but in substr() the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part. 
            The replace() method replaces a specific value with another value in a string.
            A string is converted to upper case with toUpperCase() and likewise to lowercase with toLowerCase().
            concat() joins two or more strings EX: text1.concat(" ", text2).
            All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.
            Formally said: Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.
            The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string.
            The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index(position) in a string.
            The charCodeAt() method returns the unicode of the character at a specified index in a string. 
        </p>

        <script>
        var a = "Please visit his website";
        var at = "     How do i remove white space  ";
        var b = a.replace("his", "Emmanuel's");
        var a2 = a.toUpperCase();
        var a3 = at.trim()
        var at2 = "ENTERYOURLASTNAME";
        var a4 = at2.charCodeAt(1)
        console.log(b + " " + a2 + " " + a3);
        console.log('The unicode value of the text n is', a4);

        <p>JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations. JavaScript uses the + operator to concatenate 
            You can use the global JavaScript functions isNaN() to find out if a value is a number. Infinity is the value JavaScript will return if 
            you calculate a number outside the largest possible number.
            Hexadecimal is base 16. Decimal is base 10. Octal is base 8. Binary is base 2. The toString() method returns a number as a string.
            The toString() method returns a number as a string. toExponential() returns a string, with a number rounded and written using exponential notation
            toFixed() returns a string, with the number written with a specified number of decimals. toFixed(2) is perfect for working with money.

        </p>

        <script>
        console.log(typeof(4));
        var myNumber = 2;
        while (myNumber != Infinity){
            myNumber = myNumber * myNumber;
        console.log(myNumber);
        }
        var numb = 12.435646
        var numb2 = numb.toFixed(2)
        console.log(numb2)
        </script>

        <p>
            JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
            An Array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by refering to an 
            index number. You can access an array element by referring to the index number[0]. Array indexes start with 0.
            [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element. You can change and add new values to an array by referencing the index.
            JavaScript variables can be objects so You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array.
            The length property is always one more than the highest array index.

            
        </p>

        <script>
            var cars = ["Chevrolet", "Volvo", "BMW", "Mercedes"];
            console.log(cars);
            var value = cars[2];
            cars[4] = "Toyota";
            var value2 = cars[cars.length -1];
            console.log(value,'Is at index of 2', value2, "\"-1 gives you the last element in an array\" ");
            console.log(cars[0]);
            var person = {Firstname:"Jammie", Lastname:"Vardy"}
            console.log(person.Lastname, person.Firstname);
            var x = cars.length; // returns the number of elements
            var y = cars.sort(); // The sort() method sorts arrays
            console.log(x,'is the length',y,'sorting');

        </script>

        <h2>Looping Array Elements
        </h2>

        <p>
            The Safest way to loop through an array, is using a for loop. Be <b>Careful</b> with loops so you don't end up with
            an infinite loop. when writing loops You can also use the Array.forEach() function: from (JS Arrays).
            The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the puch() method. New elements can also be added using the length property.
            In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes. In JavaScript, Objects use names indexes.
